      <h3 class="centerheader">About Me</h3>
      <p>I was born in Raliegh, NC and moved all around when I was in elementary in school. In total I believe I went to at least 3 or 4 different elementary schools before we stoppped moving.
          We finally ended up in Goldsboro, NC and I have been here since. After I graduated highschool, I decided to go to NC A&T. I started off majoring in Electrical Engineering and only having
          little experience with coding in highschool.<br><br>With Electrical Engineering you have to take an intro course to coding and I thought it was going to be a pain. However, this class opened
          up so much for me. This is the class that got me more interested in code and it helped me get my drive to apply for Google last year. Once I got my internship last year, I was also able to 
          take a study abroad class and was able to travel the world for 10 days.<br><br>Some activities that I like to do in my free time would have to be listening to music, drawing, playing video games, 
          skateboarding, watching anime, cooking, and pushing myself to try new things.</p>
