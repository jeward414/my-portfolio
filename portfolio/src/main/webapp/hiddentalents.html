  <h3 class="centerheader">Photography</h3>
      <p>For the things that I like to photograph, it would just have to be moments with my friends and family. I bought a polaroid camera exacty for the purpose to help keep memeories
        with my friends. Later on, I want to get all the pictures I took and hang them up on wall just to go through all of the photos and remember what was happening. Another thing that I
        like about photograpy is that each photo tells its own story. Like that saying "a picture has a thousand words", is very true when it comes to photos.</p>
      
      <h3 class="centerheader">Hidden Talents</h3>
      <p>
        I would not say that I have a lot of hidden talents but one of them is being able to solve a rubiks cube. It took me a while to learn how to do it, I watched tons and tons of videos 
        of people teaching how to solve the cube. Now I can solve a cube in under 2 minutes.<br><br>Another talent I have is being able to learn from something and develop skills for it very 
        fast. I have been able to pick up a game play for a few minutes, fail a few times, and be able to be almost great at the game in a short while. I think this trait was developed from 
        skateboarding. While skating, you fall a lot when you are trying to learn a new trick. You fall and fall and fall. After a while, you want to get up but you keep going regardless and 
        in the end you end up learning the trick. I think that sense of dedication and of learning the ins and outs of something has helped me to develop this trait.
