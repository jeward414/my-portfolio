      <p>I am rising junior at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. I am majoring in Computer Engineering.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">About Me</h3>
      <p>I was born in Raliegh, NC and moved all around when I was in elementary in school. In total I believe I went to at least 3 or 4 different elementary schools before we stoppped moving.
          We finally ended up in Goldsboro, NC and I have been here since. After I graduated highschool, I decided to go to NC A&T. I started off majoring in Electrical Engineering and only having
          little experience with coding in highschool.<br><br>With Electrical Engineering you have to take an intro course to coding and I thought it was going to be a pain. However, this class opened
          up so much for me. This is the class that got me more interested in code and it helped me get my drive to apply for Google last year. Once I got my internship last year, I was also able to 
          take a study abroad class and was able to travel the world for 10 days.<br><br>Some activities that I like to do in my free time would have to be listening to music, drawing, playing video games, 
          skateboarding, watching anime, cooking, and pushing myself to try new things.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Past Projects</h3>
      <p style="background-color:Red;color:White;text-align:center">Rubiks Cube (2020):</p>
      <p>I decided to make a rubiks cube during my two weeks where I did not have class and this internship had not started yet. There was a video where I followed along with someone on 
         YouTube. After I finished the video, I wanted to try to move it to NetBeans in order to try and make the Rubiks Cube with JavaFX. I was able to add a camera in which you are able to move the camera 
         with the mouse to look around the mouse to see around the cube.</p>
      <p style="background-color:Red;color:White;text-align:center">Video Game (2019):</p>
      <p>In one of my coding classes in school, we were assigned to complete major programs for the class. The major programs are essentially projects that we are assigned to complete. 
         The last major program we were given was to make a fighting video game. The game consisted of a player and an AI player. I was going to eventually add a option for 2 players but I never got around to it. 
         There are life bars, a timer, and music to indicate when the player wins, loses, or runs out of time. There is also music that plays while the fight is happening.</p>
      <p style="background-color:Red;color:White;text-align:center">Perfetto UI (2019):</p>
      <p>This the project that I worked on last year during my internship at Google. This project was open source so that usedul when people asked me what I did at Google. Perfetto is used 
         to understand what is heppeneing when apps are opened on phones and help analyze crashes or how much of the phones functions an app uses. For this project we created a way for the screen of the phone to be 
         recorded along with the insides of the phone to see what the user sees. You can see the website at <a href="https://ui.perfetto.dev/#!/">Perfetto</a>.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Photography</h3>
      <p>For the things that I like to photograph, it would just have to be moments with my friends and family. I bought a polaroid camera exacty for the purpose to help keep memeories
        with my friends. Later on, I want to get all the pictures I took and hang them up on wall just to go through all of the photos and remember what was happening. Another thing that I
        like about photograpy is that each photo tells its own story. Like that saying "a picture has a thousand words", is very true when it comes to photos.</p>
      
      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Hidden Talents</h3>
      <p>I would not say that I have a lot of hidden talents but one of them is being able to solve a rubiks cube. It took me a while to learn how to do it, I watched tons and tons of videos 
          of people teaching how to solve the cube. Now I can solve a cube in under 2 minutes.<br><br>Another talent I have is being able to learn from something and develop skills for it very 
          fast. I have been able to pick up a game play for a few minutes, fail a few times, and be able to be almost great at the game in a short while. I think this trait was developed from 
          skateboarding. While skating, you fall a lot when you are trying to learn a new trick. You fall and fall and fall. After a while, you want to get up but you keep going regardless and 
          in the end you end up learning the trick. I think that sense of dedication and of learning the ins and outs of something has helped me to develop this trait.</p>
