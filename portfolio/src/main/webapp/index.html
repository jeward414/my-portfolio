      <p>I am rising junior at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. I am majoring in Computer Engineering.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">About Me</h3>
      <p>I was born in Raliegh, NC and moved all around when I was in elementary in school. In total I believe I went to at least 3 or 4 different elementary schools before we stoppped moving.
          We finally ended up in Goldsboro, NC and I have been here since. After I graduated highschool, I decided to go to NC A&T. I started off majoring in Electrical Engineering and only having
          little experience with coding in highschool.<br><br>With Electrical Engineering you have to take an intro course to coding and I thought it was going to be a pain. However, this class opened
          up so much for me. This is the class that got me more interested in code and it helped me get my drive to apply for Google last year. Once I got my internship last year, I was also able to 
          take a study abroad class and was able to travel the world for 10 days.<br><br>Some activities that I like to do in my free time would have to be listening to music, drawing, playing video games, 
          skateboarding, watching anime, cooking, and pushing myself to try new things.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Past Projects</h3>
      <p style="background-color:Red;color:White;text-align:center">Rubiks Cube (2020):</p>
      <p>I decided to make a rubiks cube during my two weeks where I did not have class and this internship had not started yet. There was a video where I followed along with someone on 
         YouTube. After I finished the video, I wanted to try to move it to NetBeans in order to try and make the Rubiks Cube with JavaFX. I was able to add a camera in which you are able to move the camera 
         with the mouse to look around the mouse to see around the cube.</p>
      <p style="background-color:Red;color:White;text-align:center">Video Game (2019):<br>In one of my coding classes in school, we were assigned to complete major programs for the class. The major programs are essentially projects that we are assigned to complete. 
         The last major program we were given was to make a fighting video game. The game consisted of a player and an AI player. I was going to eventually add a option for 2 players but I never got around to it. 
         There are life bars, a timer, and music to indicate when the player wins, loses, or runs out of time. There is also music that plays while the fight is happening.</p>
      <p style="background-color:Red;color:White;text-align:center">Perfetto UI (2019):<br>This is the project that I worked on last year during my internship at Google. This project was open source so that usedul when people asked me what I did at Google. Perfetto is used 
         to understand what is heppeneing when apps are opened on phones and help analyze crashes or how much of the phones functions an app uses. For this project we created a way for the screen of the phone to be 
         recorded along with the insides of the phone to see what the user sees. You can see the website at <a href="https://ui.perfetto.dev/#!/">Perfetto</a>.</p>
